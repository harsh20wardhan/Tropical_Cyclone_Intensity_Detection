# 🌪️ Tropical Cyclone Intensity Detection

Welcome to the **Tropical Cyclone Intensity Detection** project! This repository contains the code and resources to predict the intensity of tropical cyclones using various machine learning models. 🌍

## 🚀 Project Overview

Tropical cyclones, also known as hurricanes or typhoons, are among the most destructive natural disasters. Accurately predicting their intensity is crucial for disaster management and preparedness. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of these predictions.

### 🌟 Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training:** Various machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Charts and graphs to visualize the performance and predictions.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harsh20wardhan/Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_Detection.git
cd Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_Detection
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the project

To start the model training and evaluation process, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

### 4. View the results

Once the model is trained, you can view the results and predictions:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## 📊 Usage

- **Data Input:** The project expects cyclone data in a specific format (described in `data/README.md`).
- **Model Training:** Customize the model parameters in `config.yaml` before running the training script.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using different metrics and visualize the results.

## 📈 Results

The model achieves an accuracy of **87%** on the test dataset. Detailed results and graphs are available in the `results/` folder.
